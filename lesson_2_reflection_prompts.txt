What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository git shows an empty repository with the location of the
 repository. I would need to initilize a repository so that I can keep track of all the 
 files and file versions

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What
	value do you thing it offers?

The staging area is the 'in between' that takes files from the working directory and places
	them in the repository. This is valuable becase, with this step, you can double check
	to make sure that you want to add something to the repsitory before doing so.
