Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: I'd want to use a remote repsoitory when I'm ready to make something public

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
  stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Pulling changes manually will allow me to have more understanding of the changes made by a
  collaborator and will help me determine if the changes made should be kept

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead
    of another?
    
A: a Fork is a copy of someone elses code on github. Its used when you want to either give the 
    original author credit or suggest some changes.
    a Clone is a a copy of someone elses code on my own local drive. Its used when you want to make 
    changes that you're not ready to share
    a branch is kind of a copy of work that belongs to you or someone else that is located on your
    own local drive. Its used when you want to make a new version or a new feature of code without
    altering the master code that is ready to be shared with others.
