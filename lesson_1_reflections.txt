How did viewing diff between two versions of a file
 help you see the bug that was introduced?

because i have windows i used the FC command or file-compare to compare files.
its does its thing by only highlighting the differences in the texts and leaves the 
similar text out

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient
 programmer in the long term?

Having easy access to the file history makes me more efficient by detecting bugs
 at a faster rate which means deadlines will be met easily.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
 like you do in Git, v having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Manual ->> Pros: having logical control, Cons: you forget to commit
Automatic ->> Pros: Never have to worry about forgetting 
		Cons: saving too many times for pointless reasons 

Why do you think some versosn control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files
 in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file seaparately?

I think Git allows multiple file saving because it was created for collaborative 
 web creation

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log  -> shows the different commit versions and lists the days/times they were commited
git diff -> shows what was added and taken away for each commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break
 something?

Using version control will make me more confident because if a bug is introduced I will
 first note what commit id I'm currently on
 second i will type git log
 third i will check each commit one at a time to find the bug
 fourth i will use git diff to see how the bug was introduced

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
